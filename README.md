# CSS UNABRIDGED

## What is this?

1. An experiment
2. The answer to a question I started to ask after noticing websites serve up 200kb - 1MB+ css files.
3. A framework I can use to apply performance tests to extreme oocss concepts

## The Question

> "How big is the entire css language? Is it bigger or smaller than 500K?"

So, what is css unabridged? It is an attempt to put the entire css language in one file.
For the most part it's a bunch of single purpose classes plus a few other utilities (like normalize.css) that I frequently use in web projects.
The file is meant to be a representation of an extreme amount of css.

I develop this in conjunction with [css uncut](http://github.com/mrmrs/css-uncut) which pushes this concept even further
by name spacing each base class to target 3 additional breakpoints.
